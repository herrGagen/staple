\begin{abstract}
We imagine passengers on an airplane being asked to swap seats so that a couple or family can sit together.  This paper focuses on minimizing the number of passenger exchanges to make all families on a plane happy.  We give a hardness proof for the general case of unbounded, heterogeneous family sizes and constant factor approximation heuristics for smaller families on idealized planes.
