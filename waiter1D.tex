\begin{abstract}
The waiter problem is a discrete packing problem where the objective is to contain the partial centers of mass of objects placed on a line within a small interval.  We introduce the problem, prove its NP completeness, and present both a bound on performance and a 2.7 factor approximation heuristic to solve the problem.
