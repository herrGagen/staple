Three problems in discrete optimization are consid-
ered and solved to varying degrees using novel algo-
rithms. Worst case behavior experiments were run
in all chapters to show that our algorithms are prac-
tical and to verify correctness.
Our first rearrangement problem of passengers
seated on an airplane is shown to be NP-hard in
general. A simplified case is solved optimally using
a greedy algorithm. The same algorithm is used as
part of a two phase approach to find a 2-factor ap-
proximation for a slightly more complex version of
the problem.
Our second chapter improves on a recently published
approach to DNA copy number analysis. We first
show that the greedy algorithm published is no bet-
ter than a approximation and then devise both a
dynamic programming PTAS and an integer pro-
gramming formulation for their model. These, along
with some obvious heuristics, were experimentally
compared to the published approach and performed
favorably.
We finish with another rearrangement problem with
applications to dynamic load balancing. For this
NP-hard problem, we devise a lower bound mea-
suring algorithm, a novel 2-factor heuristic and an
experimentally promising heuristic. To demonstrate
ease of implementation and algorithm viability, we
experimentally compared the solution quality of our
algorithms to some suggested heuristics.
